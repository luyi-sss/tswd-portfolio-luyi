# visualizing-government-debt
This dataset shows the debt-to-GDP ratio of countries between 1995 and 2019. 3 key attributes need to be identified clearly on charts: Country, Ratio, and the change or the range of ratios within the period. 

The bar chart demonstrates the ratio of different countries:  
    The use of gray and other colors perfectly differentiates the ratios of countries;  
    Easy for users to read values and make comparisons;  
    Cannot show the trend or the change;  
    Trends cannot be witnessed on the bar chart.

The grid line chart clearly shows the change in the ratio in the time period:  
    We can identify whether there is an upward or downward trend;  
    Not easy for users to read values and make comparisons;  
    Easy to lose focus.
  
Since the line chart shows the change in the ratio, different dots on the scatter plot picture the range of the ratio of each country mentioned in the dataset:    
    Cannot see the trend of the ratio of each country;  
    Not easy to read specific values when dots are overlapping;  
    Can see the maximum, the minimum, and the range;  
    Simple for users to compare ratios across different countries.
