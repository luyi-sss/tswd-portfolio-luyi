# visualizing-government-debt
This dataset shows the debt-to-GDP ratio of countries between 1995 and 2019. 3 key attributes need to be identified clearly on charts: Country, Ratio, and the change or the range of ratios within the period. 3 different data visualization ways are used to demonstrate the same dataset of the general debt from OECD.(https://data.oecd.org/)

The bar chart demonstrates the ratio of different countries:  
    The use of gray and other colors perfectly differentiates the ratios of countries;  
    Easy for users to read values and make comparisons;  
    Cannot show the trend or the change;  
    Trends cannot be witnessed on the bar chart.

The grid line chart clearly shows the change in the ratio in the time:  
    We can identify whether there is an upward or downward trend;  
    Not easy for users to read values and make comparisons;  
    I added some data labels trying to give users a data-based sense of how the ratio changed;
    However, it is easy to lose focus as the grid line charts are overdone(there are too many charts and too many countries).
  
Since the line chart shows the change in the ratio, different dots on the scatter plot picture the range of the ratio of each country mentioned in the dataset:    
    Cannot see the trend of the ratio of each country;  
    Not easy to read specific values when dots are overlapping;  
    Can see the maximum, the minimum, and the range;  
    Simple for users to compare ratios across different countries.

What I think when designing the scatter plot:  
1. The shape is a preattentive attribute for users and I want the range of ratios of different countries to be my emphasis, so I choose to draw a scatter plot.
2. To better emphasize the position of each point in the scatterplot, I chose gray as the background color and represented each point in purple. Sequential colors are good for illustrating counts. By changing the intensity of the color, it is clear to see the duration for which each country maintains a particular debt ratio. I used gray as the background color for the chart, so I also chose gray for elements like the x-axis, the y-axis, and the chart title. After using purple as the main color for the chart, I also used purple for the footer. This increases chart readability and helps limit colors as best as I can.
3. When deciding the dot style, I chose a square shape as it is easy to make comparisons, and the square dots stacked together resemble bars in bar charts, which also provides a clear view of both the maximum and minimum of the debt ratio.
4. Plus, I took off the grid lines to increase the clarity and remove redundancy.
