# Critique by design

## The original data visualization & some background information
The original data visualization is from an article in Financial Times, and it is called: [Soft commodities: orange juice gives a taste of coming volatility](https://www.ft.com/content/9619df30-cdf7-49ee-abf3-6583f2b0bcf9)
The reason why I chose it:  
1. I think this chart is quite problematic. Despite what I mentioned, I generally donâ€™t think this is a good visualization and there are a lot of things I would do differently. I think my answer will overlap with the next question, so I will give further details in the next question. 


## What I gained from the critique method and how to re-design it: 
You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.

## what your re-designed data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently.
