# About me
Hi! 
My name is Luyi.
I'm a second-year MAM student at CMU.
She/ Her pronouns.

Right now, I'm taking as many data courses as I can because I see data analysis, business analysis, and consulting as my career directory. Though I was trying to be a theater project manager before I came to CMU.:)

After working as a business intelligence intern, I found that telling a story based on data you have is equal to acquiring and analyzing data. It is the story, insights, conclusions, or trends that interest clients and stakeholders the most. I foresee myself better utilizing data to provide more effective and informative strategies and recommendations in my future work.


# What I hope to learn
All the things relating to data visualizations - obviously. 

1. More effective ways to tell stories and convey insights
2. What I did ring & what I did wrong in my previous data visualization working experience
3. To cultivate an aesthetic of data visualization
