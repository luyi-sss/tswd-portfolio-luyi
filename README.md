# Portfolio
This is my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data. I will gradually build out this repository this semester and upgrade all my work here. 
Hope this page adds a point for me when finding a job:)

## Assignment: [Visualizing government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`, where you can see my  data visualizations there.

## Assignment 3&4: critique-by-design.md
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.

# About me
Hi! 
My name is Luyi.
I'm a second-year MAM student at CMU.
She/ Her pronouns.

Right now, I'm taking as many data courses as I can because I see data analysis, business analysis, and consulting as my career directory. Though I was trying to be a theater project manager before I came to CMU.:)

After working as a business intelligence intern, I found that telling a story based on data you have is equal to acquiring and analyzing data. It is the story, insights, conclusions, or trends that interest clients and stakeholders the most. I foresee myself better utilizing data to provide more effective and informative strategies and recommendations in my future work.


# What I hope to learn
All the things relating to data visualizations - obviously. 

1. More effective ways to tell stories and convey insights
2. What I did ring & what I did wrong in my previous data visualization working experience
3. To cultivate an aesthetic of data visualization





## Other stuff I can do (just for my reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
