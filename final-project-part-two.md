# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

My target audience will be employers in the coffee industry who need industrial news and trends, people who care about climate change and sustainable development, and coffee lovers. Audiences generally know about this topic and are highly interested in the coffee industry and potential strategies to deal with changes within the industry. Even if audiences don't have specific knowledge about coffee, their educational backgrounds enable them to understand the information when they see the chart quickly. They want to gain high-value information efficiently from data visualization and catch up with the content.

## Interview findings

| Interview 1 (early 20s)                                                                                  | Interview 2 (mid 20s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Interview 3 (mid 20s)                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 1. the solution part has too many texts.                                                                 | 1. I find the second and third slides a bit confusing <br>because they give me a feeling that 'coffee beans are going extinct,' <br>but the charts below show that demands exceed consumption. It doesn't convey the same idea.                                                                                                       | 1. I found it confusing that you mentioned the production decreases due to climate change,<br> but in your first chart, both production and consumption are increasing, <br>which is not persuasive and intuitive to me. |
| 2. The subtitles of graphs are confusing, <br>I don't know if they are subtitles or legends for the y-axis.<br>  | 2.I think it would be better for the global consumption stacked area chart to have some annotations. <br>It can better help readers to grab the information that consumption doubled.                                                                                                                                                 | 2. You didn't elaborate on how extreme weather makes it harder to plant coffee trees in traditional regions.                                                                                                             |
| 3. remember to check grammar and sentences.                                                             | 3. When discussing the reasons for the decline in coffee production, <br>I think it would be beneficial <br>to add a sentence explaining why coffee beans' sensitivity to extreme weather affects coffee production. <br>(Because what you ultimately want to convey is that climate change is causing a reduction in coffee yields.) |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 4. remember to delete all blank templates and irrelevant pages.                                          | 4. In general, I think what you are trying to say is not the risk of demand exceeding supply,<br> What you are trying to say is the current production cannot cover the increasing demand. <br>This could be an issue for your reader to comprehend your statements.                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

| overall logic        | A solid logic would be: current issue - supplies cannot fulfill the increasing consumption.<br>Drinking coffee would be a luxury if the increase in retail prices continues<br>why - climate change makes traditional tropical coffee bean producers harder to plant coffee trees + <br>major profit doesn't go to coffee growers, so they are leaving this industry<br>solution - plant coffee trees in new suitable areas, <br>research into more resilient plants, <br>better disease and pest control, and best practices in farm management.  |   |

Currently, the narrative logic needs to be finalized, as readers find it confusing. It is interesting and helpful to see how other people comprehend the same visualization in a different way because this visualization services its readers, rather than its author. Readers feedback are always important.
More content to support the storytelling needs to be added.
